# Saban

Saban is my attempt to add more automation into my hacking workflow. Currently, I type or copy and paste most of the commands that I use. Taking this approach has been great for learning and understanding what is going on.

I have noticed a lot of the capture the flag machines that I have worked on have similar patterns and I would like to try adding automation. I am not trying to replace things that humans do well.
